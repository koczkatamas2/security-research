As far as I am aware kernel heap data only attacks using kernel/user shared memory have
gained little to no attention yet.

The `struct xdp_mem` with the `AF_XDP` socket ([docs](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/af_xdp.html))
used in this exploit seems to serve as a powerful primitive:
Advantages:
- Read / Write of "kernel" memory without restrictions (even fault shenanigans seem like a good idea,
    though I did not explicitly look into this)
- No heap pointers required
- No size restrictions even though acting as a `kmalloc-128` object
- Very useful as a "fake list member"

Disadvantages:
- One level of pointer indirection
- Initial pointer restricted to `kmalloc-128`
- Requires `CAP_NET_RAW`

Depending on the primitives available unaligned pointer corruption may come in handy
when dealing with objects where the mapped member does not align with the desired pointer.
